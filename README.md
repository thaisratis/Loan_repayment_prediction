# Loan Repayment Prediction

This repository contains a project that predicts the Loan Repayment Prediction.

The prediction was performed with classification algorithms:
- Decision tree (DT);
- Random Forest (RF);
-Support Vector Machine (SVM);
-K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN);
-Artificial Neural Network (ANN);
-Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (Xgboost).

Also, the database is unbalanced. Thus, I performed an over-sampling techniques to create synthetic examples using:
-Naive random over-sampling (RandomOverSampler);
-Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE);
-Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN).

In addition, I perform Grid Search method to tuning the hyperparameters of an estimator.
